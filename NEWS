In 1.0.0.0
----------

 - Entirely different approach, see the documentation overview.
 - s6-halt, s6-poweroff, s6-reboot removed.
 - s6-linux-init-maker now produces a set of executable scripts
that are a drop-in replacement for a sysvinit installation, and
that respect the LSB-3.0.0 specification.
 - Everything builds as PIC by default.
   

In 0.4.0.0
----------

 - The old /etc/rc.shutdown is now created by s6-linux-init-maker
