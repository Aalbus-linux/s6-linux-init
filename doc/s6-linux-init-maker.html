<h1> The <tt>s6-linux-init-maker</tt> program </h1>

<p>
<tt>s6-linux-init-maker</tt> reads configuration options on
the command line, and outputs a directory to place in the
root filesystem as well as a script suitable as an init program.
</p>

<p>
 s6-linux-init-maker only writes scripts. At boot time, these
scripts will call commands provided by other skarnet.org packages
such as
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/execline/">execline</a> or
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6/">s6</a>. It is the
responsibility of the administrator to make sure that all the
dependencies are properly installed at boot time, and that the
correct options have been given to s6-linux-init-maker so that
the programs are found <em>on the root filesystem of the
machine</em> - else the scripts will crash.
</p>

</p>

<h2> Interface and usage </h2>

<pre>
     s6-linux-init-maker \
       [ -c <em>basedir</em> ] \
       [ -l <em>tmpfsdir</em> ] \
       [ -b <em>execline_bindir</em> ] \
       [ -u <em>log_user</em> ] \
       [ -g <em>early_getty</em> ] \
       [ -2 <em>stage2</em> ] \
       [ -3 <em>stage3</em> ] \
       [ -p <em>initial_path</em> ] \
       [ -m <em>initial_umask</em> ] \
       [ -t <em>timestamp_style</em> ] \
       [ -d <em>dev_style</em> ] \
       [ -e <em>initial_envvar</em> ] ... \
       <em>dir</em> &gt; <em>stage1</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-linux-init-maker should be run as root. </li>
 <li> s6-linux-init-maker parses options on its command line. </li>
 <li> It writes data into a directory <em>dir</em>, which must not
exist beforehand. </li>
 <li> It then prints a script to its standard output. </li>
 <li> It exits 0 if everything went well, 100 if a user error occurred,
and 111 if a problem occurred during the directory or script creation. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 <em>dir</em> should then be copied by the administrator to the place
declared as <em>basedir</em>. Be careful: it contains fifos, files with
precise uid/gid permissions, and files with non-standard access rights,
so be sure to copy it verbatim. The
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6-portable-utils/s6-hiercopy.html">s6-hiercopy</a>
tool can do it, as well as the GNU or busybox <tt>cp -a</tt> command.
</p>

<p>
 The <em>stage1</em> script printed by s6-linux-init-maker on its
stdout is then suitable as an init program. The administrator should
copy it to <tt>/sbin/init</tt> and make it executable.
</p>

<h2> Boot sequence </h2>

<p>
 When the kernel boots, it runs the <em>stage1</em> script, and this is
what happens:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <em>stage1</em> is an
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/execline/">execline</a> script, so
the first process run by the kernel is the
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/execline/execlineb.html">execlineb</a>
program launcher. </li>
 <li> <em>stage1</em> mounts a
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt">tmpfs</a>
filesystem on <em>tmpfsdir</em>. </li>
 <li> <em>stage1</em> copies <tt><em>basedir</em>/run-image</tt> verbatim to
<em>tmpfsdir</em>. </li>
 <li> <em>stage1</em> reads a global set of environment variables from the
<tt><em>basedir</em>/env</tt>
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-envdir.html">environment directory</a>. </li>
 <li> <em>stage1</em> forks a child that will block until
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-svscan.html">s6-svscan</a> is running. </li>
 <li> <em>stage1</em> executes, as process 1, into
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-svscan.html">s6-svscan</a>,
with <tt><em>tmpfsdir</em>/service</tt> as a
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6/scandir.html">scan directory</a>. </li>
 <li> This scan directory already contains at least one service, which is the
<em>catch-all logger</em>: error messages from the supervision tree, and
from services that do not have a dedicated logger, are handled by a
special <a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-log.html">s6-log</a>
instance and made available in <tt><em>tmpfsdir</em>/uncaught-logs</tt>
instead of clogging the system console. </li>
 <li> If the <tt>-g</tt> option has been given to s6-linux-init-maker, the
scan directory will also contain a service for an early getty. </li>
 <li> s6-svscan starts all the services defined in the scan directory,
and unblocks the child forked by <em>stage1</em>. </li>
 <li> This child executes into <em>stage2</em>. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 <em>stage2</em> is the responsibility of the administrator - it will
not be written automatically!
It should
contain all the necessary initialization sequence to bring up a proper
system. When <em>stage2</em> is executed, the machine state is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <em>stage2</em>'s working directory is <tt>/</tt> and its stdin
is <tt>/dev/null</tt>. <em>stage2</em>'s
stdout and stderr both point to the pipe to the catch-all logger, so
unless redirected, <em>stage2</em>'s output will be logged into the
<tt><em>tmpfsdir/uncaught-logs</em></tt> directory. </li>
 <li> The system has a valid device directory mounted on <tt>/dev</tt>.
 <li> Depending on the kernel boot command line, the root filesystem
may be in read-only mode. </li>
 <li> There is a tmpfs available for root only in <em>tmpfsdir</em>. </li>
 <li> <a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-svscan.html">s6-svscan</a>
is running as process 1. At any time, it is possible to make it supervise a long-lived
process by linking the appropriate
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6/servicedir.html">service directory</a>
into <tt><em>tmpfsdir</em>/service</tt>, then running the command
<tt>s6-svscanctl -a <em>tmpfsdir</em>/service</tt>. Services without a
dedicated logger will send their output to the catch-all logger. </li>
 <li> A getty service may already be available. The point of this early
getty is essentially to make it easier to debug if <em>stage2</em> fails. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 There is <em>nothing else</em>. In particular, no filesystem has been
mounted yet, including <tt>/proc</tt> and <tt>/sys</tt>; and no one-time
initialization
has been performed. The point of <em>stage1</em> is only to make it
possible to run <em>stage2</em> with a logging infrastructure and a
supervision infrastructure already available, and all the
real machine and service initialization should happen in <em>stage2</em>.
</p>

<h2> Shutdown sequence </h2>

<p>
 When s6-svscan is told to exit via an appropriate
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-svscanctl.html">s6-svscanctl</a>
command, it executes into the <em>stage3</em> script, which, like
<em>stage2</em>, is the responsibility of the administrator. <em>stage3</em>
is run in the following state:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> It runs as process 1. (Doing so makes it easier to recover after
killing all processes by <tt>kill -9 -1</tt> or
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6-portable-utils/s6-nuke.html">s6-nuke</a>). </li>
 <li> Its working directory is <tt>/</tt> and its stdin is <tt>/dev/null</tt> </li>
 <li> Its stdout and stderr are both <tt>/dev/console</tt> </li>
 <li> Depending on the exact s6-svscanctl command that terminated s6-svscan,
and what has happened before that command was sent, there may or may not be
long-running services that remain alive. The catch-all logger and its
supervisor will <em>always</em> be alive, which is not a problem because they
do not hold any file descriptor to a filesystem that would need to be
unmounted. </li>
</ul>

<h2> s6-linux-init-maker options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-c</tt>&nbsp;<em>basedir</em>&nbsp;: at boot time, <em>stage1</em>
will read its read-only data from <em>basedir</em>. After running
s6-linux-init-maker, the administrator should make sure to copy the
created directory <em>dir</em> to <em>basedir</em>. <em>basedir</em>
must be absolute. Default is
<strong><tt>/etc/s6</tt></strong>. </li> <p />

 <li> <tt>-l</tt>&nbsp;<em>tmpfsdir</em>&nbsp;: at boot time, a tmpfs will
be mounted on <em>tmpfsdir</em>. The directory should already exist in
the root filesystem, and be empty. <em>tmpfsdir</em> must be absolute. Default is
<strong><tt>/run</tt></strong>. </li> <p />

 <li> <tt>-b</tt>&nbsp;<em>execline_bindir</em>&nbsp;: init is run by the kernel
without a PATH, and since it is a script, it is necessary to tell it where
to find the
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/execline/execlineb.html">execlineb</a>
launcher and the first few early commands before PATH can be set.
<em>execline_bindir</em> is the location where the execline binaries can be
found. It must be absolute. Default is
<strong><tt>/bin</tt></strong>. </li> <p />

 <li> <tt>-u</tt>&nbsp;<em>log_user</em>&nbsp;: the catch-all
logger will not run as root, but as <em>log_user</em>. Default is
<strong><tt>nobody</tt></strong>. </li> <p />

 <li> <tt>-g</tt>&nbsp;<em>early_getty</em>&nbsp;: if this option
is set, s6-linux-init-maker will define a service that will run
very early, before <em>stage2</em> is executed. This early service
should be a getty, to allow logins even if <em>stage2</em> fails.
<em>early_getty</em> should be a simple command line: for instance,
<tt>"/sbin/getty 38400 tty1"</tt>. By default, no early service
is defined. </li> <p />

 <li> <tt>-2</tt>&nbsp;<em>stage2</em>&nbsp;: <em>stage2</em> is
the location of the stage 2 script that will be run when the
system has an operational supervision tree. It must be absolute. Default is
<strong><tt>/etc/rc.init</tt></strong>. </li> <p />

 <li> <tt>-3</tt>&nbsp;<em>stage3</em>&nbsp;: <em>stage3</em> is
the location of the stage 3 script that will be run at the end of
the machine lifetime, when s6-svscan is told to terminate.
It must be absolute. Default is
<strong><tt>/etc/rc.shutdown</tt></strong>. </li> <p />

 <li> <tt>-p</tt>&nbsp;<em>initial_path</em>&nbsp;: the value to
set the PATH environment variable to, for all the starting processes.
This will be done as early as possible in <em>stage1</em>. Default is
the value that has been compiled in
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/skalibs/">skalibs</a> via the
<tt>--with-default-path</tt> configure option, i.e. by default
<strong><tt>/usr/bin:/bin</tt></strong>. </li> <p />

 <li> <tt>-m</tt>&nbsp;<em>initial_umask</em>&nbsp;: the value of
the initial file umask for all the starting processes, in octal.
Default is
<strong><tt>022</tt></strong>. </li> <p />

 <li> <tt>-t</tt>&nbsp;<em>timestamp_style</em>&nbsp;: how
logs are timestamped by the catch-all logger. 0 means no
timestamp, 1 means
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/libtai/tai64.html">external TAI64N format</a>,
2 means
<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm">ISO 8601 format</a>,
and 3 means both. Default is
<strong><tt>1</tt></strong>. </li> <p />

 <li> <tt>-d</tt>&nbsp;<em>dev_style</em>&nbsp;: how <tt>/dev</tt> is
handled on this system. 0 means a static <tt>/dev</tt>, 1 means
devtmpfs but not automounted by the kernel at boot time, and 2 means
devtmpfs automounted by the kernel at boot time. Default is
<strong><tt>2</tt></strong>. </li> <p />

 <li> <tt>-e</tt>&nbsp;<em>initial_envvar</em>&nbsp;: this option
can be repeated. For every <em>initial_envvar</em>, s6-linux-init-maker
will adjust the global environment directory in <em>dir</em>/env.
<em>initial_envvar</em> must either be of the form <em>VAR</em>,
to make sure that <em>VAR</em> does not appear in the global
environment, or of the form <em>VAR=VALUE</em>, to add an
environment variable <em>VAR</em> with the value <em>VALUE</em>.
The TZ variable, for instance, is a good candidate to be set in
the global environment. </li> <p />
</ul>
